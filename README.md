# About me
### Hi, I am Aarush!
I am a third-year Computer Science Engineering student with a passion for innovative technology and its many intersections with the dynamic world of econometrics, my minor.
As an aspiring tech professional developing skills in data analytics, my academic journey has allowed me to make strides in bridging the gap between these two drastically different subjects. I am inquisitive and committed to detail, and always on the hunt for opportunities to expand my skillset and apply them in the real world.
I am excited to embark on a life-long career in these fields and make a difference in the industry on a global scale.
